# ðŸ‘ª Registering Users

## Step 1 - Click on "Register" on your menu-bar/sidebar

{% hint style="info" %}
Check previous page to see the [menu-bar/sidebar](../getting-started/menu-bar-side-bar.md)
{% endhint %}

The profile interface allows users to input all necessary details. For accuracy, please ensure that all details are entered correctly. Users can edit or delete details using the "View" component of the [menu-bar/sidebar](../getting-started/menu-bar-side-bar.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The software automatically generates a unique "Attendance ID" for each user. This ID serves as a unique identifier for users within the software. By default, the ID is not displayed on the user ID card unless the feature is enabled from the profile settings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Filling in the "Telephone 1" field is of utmost importance, while "Telephone 2" can be left blank as it is optional. It is mandatory to fill in all other fields except for these two.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The software only allows for JPEG and JPG image types when uploading student passport photos. Other image types are not supported.
{% endhint %}

## Step 2 - Click on the "Submit Details" button to submit

{% hint style="warning" %}
Upon submitting your registration, it is crucial to pay close attention to any error notifications that may appear. These notifications will inform you whether your registration was successful or not.
{% endhint %}

After submitting your registration, the user's records are saved to the database. If successful, a confirmation interface is displayed to indicate that the registration process has been completed.
