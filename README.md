# 🏥 Automated Attendance System (v2.2.0)

## Overview

Welcome to Hynitr's automated attendance management system documentation where you’ll learn how to use the management system for tracking your organization's attendance in real-time with automated notifications.



## What's New in v2.2.0? 😎

> * **Real-time WhatsApp Notification:**&#x20;
>
> With the implementation of a real-time notification system on WhatsApp, parents are now able to ascertain the precise time and date that their wards entered and left the school directly through their registered WhatsApp phone number, which was supplied during the ward registration process on the attendance management system. This innovative approach not only improves efficiency but also helps to reduce costs, which would typically have been associated with the bulk SMS credit charged for sending notifications.

> The Mailchimp Marketing API provides programmatic access to Mailchimp data and functionality, allowing developers to build custom features to do things like sync email activity and campaign analytics with their database, manage audiences and campaigns, and more.
