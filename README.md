# 🏥 Automated Attendance System (v2.2.0)

## Overview ✌️

Welcome to Hynitr's automated attendance management system documentation where you’ll learn how to use the management system for tracking your organization's attendance in real-time with automated notifications.



## What's New in v2.2.0? 😎

> * **Real-time WhatsApp Notification:**&#x20;
>
> With the implementation of a real-time notification system on WhatsApp, parents/admin are now able to ascertain the precise time and date that their wards/staff entered and left the school/organization directly through their registered WhatsApp phone number, which was supplied during the ward/staff registration process on the attendance management system. This innovative approach not only improves efficiency but also helps to reduce costs, which would typically have been associated with the bulk SMS credit charged for sending notifications.



> * **Bulk SMS Balance**
>
> Administrators can now view their current bulk SMS credit directly from the attendance dashboard without the need to access the bulk SMS platform. This feature facilitates the determination of the remaining bulk SMS credits available for sending messages and enables administrators to ascertain whether parents/admin will receive SMS notifications.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the event that the bulk SMS credit is low or depleted, SMS notifications will not be sent to parents. It is advisable to consistently monitor the attendance dashboard to obtain up-to-date information on the status of the bulk SMS credit.
{% endhint %}

> * **Automated Software Renewal**
>
> The software is now equipped with an integrated renewal system that enables users to renew their software when it is due. The need to contact a customer support representative for assistance with renewal is eliminated. Upon receipt of payment for the renewal, the software will automatically update itself to the next renewal date.

{% hint style="info" %}
The software will no longer be functional once it reaches its renewal deadline unless it is renewed. To ensure continuous operation of the software, an annual renewal fee must be paid. It is recommended to regularly monitor the renewal timer on your dashboard to ensure timely renewal.
{% endhint %}

> * **Eliminated Multiple Attendance Logs**
>
> The upgraded version of the software now includes an attendance log that provides insight into the attendance status of staff and students, including absentees, latecomers, and frequency of tardiness or absence. The log effectively eliminates the potential for duplicate attendance entries when ID cards are scanned. Additionally, the software is now equipped with a feature that detects invalid ID cards and security keys.
