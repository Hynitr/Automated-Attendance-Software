{% hint style="info" %}
The software automatically generates a unique "Attendance ID" for each user. This ID serves as a unique identifier for users within the software. By default, the ID is not displayed on the user ID card unless the feature is enabled from the profile settings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Filling in the "Telephone 1" field is of utmost importance, while "Telephone 2" can be left blank as it is optional. It is mandatory to fill in all other fields except for these two.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The software only allows for JPEG and JPG image types when uploading student passport photos. Other image types are not supported.
